Full disclosure: I've never written code to connect to a database server hosted somewhere other than the machine the code was running on.
This SHOULD be how it works in Python for our project, if it isn't:

1) Put these 3 lines at the begininning of your code (note that the second line is the part I'm not sure I've got right):

import mysql.connector
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user = 'user', password = 'team_terminal', host = '96.244.68.135', port = 3306, database = 'SCHEDULER')
db = cnx.cursor()

2) Do a query similar to what's seen at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-example-cursor-transaction.html
For example: 

add_room = ("INSERT INTO room " 
            "(r_building, r_no, r_capacity, r_tech, r_type) "
               "VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)")
               
data_room = ('ITE', '101', 100, true, 'LECTURE')

db.execute(add_room, data_room)

cnx.commit()
db.close()
cnx.close()

3) If you get an error message executing the above query try changing the building or room number, someone else might have already
added that room and duplicates aren't allowed.

3a) Also note if you tried to do a drop or create query, the user profile doesn't have access to those, try an insert

4) If you still can't get it to work contact me (Joey) and make sure my computer/Internet are working (I'm hosting the server locally,
I'll leave it running but shit happens)
