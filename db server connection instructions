Update 4/1: Michael and I got successfully tested the code below

This is how conencting to the database works in Python for our project:

1) Put these 3 lines at the begininning of your code (note that the second line is the part I'm not sure I've got right):

import mysql.connector
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(user = 'user', password = 'team_terminal', host = '96.244.68.135', port = 3306, database = 'SCHEDULER', buffered = true)
db = cnx.cursor()

2) Do a query similar to what's seen at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-example-cursor-transaction.html
For example: 

add_room = ("INSERT INTO room " 
            "(r_building, r_no, r_capacity, r_tech, r_type) "
               "VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)")
               
data_room = ('ITE', '101', 100, true, 'LECTURE')

db.execute(add_room, data_room)

cnx.commit()
db.close()
cnx.close()

3) If you get an error message executing the above query try changing the building (ITE) or room number (101), someone else might 
have already added that room and duplicates aren't allowed.

4) If you still can't get it to work contact me (Joey) and make sure my computer/Internet are working (I'm hosting the server locally,
I'll leave it running but shit happens)
