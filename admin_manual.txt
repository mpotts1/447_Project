Installation/execution instructions for application:



Installation/configuration instructions for database server:

(Note that this section was included just for completeness; the connection as specified in the source code for this project will work for testing/grading purposes)

On the server machine, install and run a MySQL-compatible database system(The application was built using the MySQL community server package from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

Change the IP and port (and username/password, if neccessary) in the connection declarations located in the python scripts handling sql queries

On the server machine with the server running, execute the file "createAll.sql"

If the application cannot connect, verify that the firewall settings for the server machine allow incoming traffic on the port assigned to the server.



Database maintenance scripts:

Executing "insertTestData.sql" will fill the room table with the rooms specified by the project documentation
Executing "clearTables.sql" will empty all the project tables, but leave the tables themselves intact, ready to be filled
Executing "dropAll.sql" will delete the tables and database themselves. You'll need to execute "createAll.sql" after this to use the database again.
